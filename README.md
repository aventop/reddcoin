What is Reddcoin?
----------------

Reddcoin first started in January 2014 as a variant of Litecoin using Scrypt as
the Proof-of-Work hash algorithm.
 - 1 minute block target
 - subsidy halves in 500,000 blocks
 - ~109 billion total coins
 - 100,000 coins per block
 - Difficulty Retarget: Every block using Kimoto's gravity well.

Reddcoin is in transition to its own designed Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) which
will replace Proof-of-Work (PoW) in second half of 2014.
 - 1 minute block target
 - subsidy halves every 50,000 blocks starting at block 140,000
 - ~30 billion mined during the PoW era
 - 5% annual interest once in PoSV era

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Reddcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
appropriate channels.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/reddcoin-project/reddcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Reddcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,
and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be
used for manual QA testing â€” a link to them will appear in a comment on the
pull request posted by [BitcoinPullTester](https://github.com/BitcoinPullTester). See https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts
for the build/test scripts.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.
See https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/ for how to create a test plan.
